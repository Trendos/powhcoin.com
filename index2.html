<p> Very Interesting, This exploit has now been run on nearly every CLONE site of PoWH there was.</p>
<p> If you have eth in any clone sites, or sites that work similarly, please Exit out of them now until you can verify they wrote new code from scratch </p>


<p> Friendly reminder that even if your development team does not code an exit hatch in, the Russians will make one for you</p>
<p> Give me some time to change all the text on the site to JUST, and we'll have some more announcements for you. </p>

<p>Gonna have to pull out the DOUBLE JUSTED role for this one</p>

<p>I'm the dev for most of the artwork, and nearly any text you've read on any of the pages desperately pleading you to not trust our insane mathematical gambling robot with your ethereum</p>
<p>You can contact me on Discord, i'm Ponzi-Bot and i'll leave you an email address to spam shortly with death threats</p>
<p>Make em good</p>

<li><p>Some Info, if you're not in the Loop</p></li>
<p>The PoWH Development team has actually disbanded after PoWH Shadow crashed </p>
<p>They quickly realized that for a joke site it exploded to a size it was never intended to reach and people put faith into it that we TOLD YOU NOT TO HAVE.</p>
<p>There's currently a new development team with some very high-quality programmers working on a complete full rewrite of the Smart Contract code, </p>
<p>We are in contact with one of the groups who determined the stack overflow exploit existed, and will go through steps to ensure that new code does not have these exploits</p>
<p>i would suggest not touching any of the schemes that look like they use this old code, which is all of them since they copy/pasted it </p>
<p>I'd probably suggest not touching our new one too, but someone's going to FoMo in anyway</p>



<p>You probably can't get out now, but here's the escape hatch code just in case</p>
<p><li><b>PLEASE SAVE THIS SOMEWHERE SAFE</b> If for any reason this website goes down, you can open up a Transaction through Metamask, Send 0 Ether with a 150k Gas Limit to the Contract and send "0xb1e35242" under additional data for a personal exit scheme. This is the getMeOutOfHere() function on the contract and will cash you out of all tokens and dividends. </li></p>
