<p> Very Interesting, This exploit has now been run on nearly every CLONE site of PoWH there was.
If you have eth in any clone sites, or sites that work similarly, please Exit out of them now until you can verify they wrote new code from scratch </p>
<p><b>This includes ethpyramid, who has at this point copy/pasted our work four times now, including almost releasing the exact same broken shadow-fork within an hour of us</b></p>

<h1>Be aware, users have found that this exploit may work on various types of ERC20 Tokens that do not use protections specifically against it;</h1>

 <p>you're a cool guy anon don't go to erc20 tomorrow</p>
 <p>Stay tuned, the dev programming team that deployed the original PoWH code is already long gone after they lost everything in the Shadow crash,
 there's a new team working on a freshly built smart contract to continue the project/coingame ideals who are well into a full rewrite of shadow code.</p>
 <p>Do not put your ethereum into copycat games until verifying that they have completely written the smart contract from the ground up.</p>
